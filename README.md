 Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression 

Step 1: Importing Libraries
Essential libraries are imported for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization:
NumPy: For numerical computations and array handling.
Pandas: For managing and analyzing data, especially tabular data in DataFrames.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning and statistical modeling, including preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating various plots and visualizations to better understand the data and results.

Step 2: Loading the Dataset
Load the dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.

Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values:
Numeric Columns: Fill missing values with the median.
Categorical Columns: Fill missing values with the mode.
Converting Categorical Features to Numerical: Use one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into a numerical format.

Step 4: Feature Engineering
Identify the input features (X) and the target variable (y). The input features are all columns except the target variable, which is the column the model will predict (e.g., 'SalePrice').

Step 5: Data Splitting
Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing sets (20%).

Step 6: Feature Scaling
Standardize the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This ensures that all features contribute equally to the model's performance.

Step 7: Model Training
Train a Linear Regression model on the training data. Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful method for predicting a continuous target variable.

Step 8: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model’s performance using various metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.
R² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variables.

Step 9: Feature Importance
In linear regression, the importance of each feature can be interpreted through the model's coefficients, indicating the weight or impact of each feature on the target variable.

Step 10: Visualization
Visualize the model's predictions using a scatter plot, comparing actual values with predicted values to assess how well the model performs.
